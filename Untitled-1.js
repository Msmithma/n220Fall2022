//Create an application with two input fields and one button.

//When the button is clicked, verify the user has written these (exact) strings in the first and second field:

//First field should be  "Username"
//Second field should be  "Password"
//If the two fields match, update a DIV on the page with the text "Success" or else "Wrong information".

//For this assignment: use only one if statement to to the check.

//Remember you'll need to use the double-equals (==) to check for equality, and the double-ampersand to check if two things are true.

//if( (oneThingIsTrue) && (anotherThingIsTrue) ) {

//}
