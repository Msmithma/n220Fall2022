//Create a number guessing name, using an input and a button to gather a number.
//The number to be guessed should be a hard-coded whole number between 1 and 20.
//Tell the user if the number is too high, equal to, or too low than a number you have hard-coded in your application.
//Remove the text in the input when the user clicks the button.

//utilize the html document 
var x = document.getElementById("Submit guess")


//create if/else statements for number guessing 
//print message according to user's guess
if (number == x) {
    print("Correct")
}
else { (number > x || number < x) 
    print("Try again")
