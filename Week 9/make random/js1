//Create a function that generates and returns a random whole number between 0 and 10. 
//Write a web page to test it by having a button that, when clicked runs a function that: 
// Uses that function to generate a random number. - Displays that number on the screen.
// Your final application should have two functions - one to make the random number, and one to handle the click.


// Generates random integer from 0 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);

//use object.onclick
object.onclick = function(Display("number")){run};
document.getElementById("click");
