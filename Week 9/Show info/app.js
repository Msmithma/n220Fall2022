//Show info

//Create an application with an array of strings, at least three. 
//Create three buttons that are associated with those strings. 
//(For instance, you might have 'home', 'about', and 'art'), and a div to display those strings. 
//Using a single function, make it so that when a button is clicked, the div displays the string associated with it in that array. 
//("home" button shows index 0, "about" shows index 1, so on..).

//Hint: 
//You can include an argument in your onclick function invocation: 
//<button onclick="doThing(12)">This rules</button>



 //create array of strings 
 const store = ["home", "about", "art"]; 
 let index = store.indexOf("art", 2); 

 object.onclick = function(){Showsomething};
