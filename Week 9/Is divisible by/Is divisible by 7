//Create an application that with an 
//input and a button. When the user clicks on the button, 
//update a div on the page to tell the user if what the user typed into the input
//is divisible by 7 or not. Use a separate function from the onclick function to discern if it is divisible
//This function should return either true if it is divisible  or false if it is not.

//create bools and loops
